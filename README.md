# Patisseria: Order iOS Mobile Application Prototype for ABC Bakery

<p align="justify">
ABC Bakery, based on a real bakery shop located at Ormiston Mall, Auckland, New Zealand, is one of Auckland’s premier bakery providers. They specialise in region-specific curated bakery products and have a strong presence in the local Asian community.  Customers can order products physically at the shop or in WeChat. However, the current online ordering process is confusing and inefficient, as it directs customers through multiple pages between their website, WeChat, and another external site. The project will be developed using ​the <b>scrum methodology​</b>. 

The mobile application prototype will have the necessary functionalities for a mobile order system by having multi-user features for admin and customers. It consists of a login and registration page, CRUD products, product information with filter and search features, wish list page, cart, and checkout. It also integrates a visual impairment component which adjusts the application’s layout for visually impaired young to older adults in Auckland, New Zealand. 
</p>

## Aim and Objectives

  <li>Improve user experience and design to attract a wider range of customers.</li>
  <li>Develop an iOS prototype mobile application using Swift Storyboard and MySQL</li>
  <li>Promote mobile application usage by providing more information about ABC Bakery such as product information.</li>
  <li>Research on different features that could be added onto the application.</li>
</ul>
</p>
